For recurring payments you will need a supported payment method. You have to activate "SEPA Direct Debit" or "Creditcard" to use recurring payments.

Yes! GET variables are possible to prefill form: ?form_ID_field_INDEX=value (replace ID with form id and INDEX with the field index. First field is 0, second field is 1 etc.)
For filling in the open amount, use "form_ID_amount" and for selecting a price option use "form_ID_priceoption"

= Can I use shortcodes? =

Yes! The following shortcodes are available:

* [rfmp id="ID"] To display the form. Replace ID with the id of the form
* [rfmp-total id="ID"] To display the total raised money. Replace ID with the id of the form
* [rfmp-goal id="ID" goal="1000" text="Goal reached!"] Countdown to your goal. Replace ID with the id of the form, goal must be higher then 0 and the text will be displayed when the goal is reached

* rfmp_form_submitted,      post ID, $_POST data
